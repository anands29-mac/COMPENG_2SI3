Snake Game 🎮
Welcome to the Snake Game! This project showcases the implementation of a classic Snake game using C and C++, leveraging object-oriented programming principles and efficient data structures to deliver an optimized and seamless gameplay experience.

🚀 Features
Movement & Collision Detection: Smooth and accurate snake movement with precise collision handling.

Scoring System: Tracks the player’s score dynamically, rewarding strategic gameplay.

Efficient Algorithms:

Arrays, queues, and linked lists were used to enhance game mechanics, achieving a 20% boost in efficiency.

Binary Search Trees (BST) were implemented for pathfinding and optimization, reducing gameplay latency by 15%.

Object-Oriented Design: Modular and reusable code structure following OOP principles.

Fully Functional: Meets all game requirements with 100% completion of features.
